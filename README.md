# NumberGuessingGame 🔢 ⏸ ▶️

First semester. The second obligatory Java project.

Javax.swing's input and message boxes will be used in this exercise.

The task is to create a program for a numbers game.

The program should generate a random integer (random number) between 0 and 200 (both limits included). The player should try to guess at this number.

The user shall be informed whether the guess is greater than or less than the unknown number

Then a new reading  will be made. This should continue until the player has guessed correctly. 
This will then be notified together with the number of guesses that were made.
